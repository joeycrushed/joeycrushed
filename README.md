## Hi, I'm Joe.

I graduated as a full stack developer in web development at Le Wagon, London. I have knowledge of React, Ruby on Rails, Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SASS, Figma/Wireframes, Github, Heroku. Since graduating I have been furthering my knowledge by learning the React library and continuing to build on my JavaScript Skills.
